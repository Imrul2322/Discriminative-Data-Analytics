# Discriminative-Data-Analytics
Here we proposed a novel discriminative analysis method called DNA which can extract ranking of features from a dataset. We have demonstrated our results and findings we got from our study on unique information extraction. At first, I will give brief introduction of the dataset used and then will discuss about the model and applications.

# Google Trends Covid-19 Symptomâ€™s Dataset
Google Trends is a free and easy-to-use dataset provided by Google (Google LLC. 2021). This anonymized, aggregated dataset depicts trends in symptom search patterns and is meant to aid academics in better understanding COVID-19's impact. Trends in search behaviors, according to public health specialists, may be useful in gaining a better understanding of how COVID-19 affects communities and perhaps in spotting epidemics sooner. It is not possible to presume that the data is a record of real-world clinical events or to use it for medical diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy. This information shows the number of Google searches for a wide range of symptoms, indications, and illnesses. We'll refer to all of them as symptoms in this paper to make things easy. The data covers hundreds of symptoms, including fever, difficulty breathing, and stress, and is based on the following factors: the prevalence of a symptom in Google searches, data quality, and privacy concerns. Number of searches linked to each of these symptoms are counted on a daily basis and categorize the data by geographic location. The generated dataset is a daily or weekly time series for each location that shows the relative frequency of symptom queries. A single search query can be associated with multiple symptoms. A search for "acid reflux with coughing up mucus," for example, yields three symptoms: cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and heartburn. Even though the dataset is being released in English, searches are being counted in other languages.
